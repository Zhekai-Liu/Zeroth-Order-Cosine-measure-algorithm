# Zeroth-Order-Cosine-measure-algorithm

Positive spanning is a crucial definition in derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems. A popular way to measure the quality of positive spanning is using the cosine measure. However, in reality, how to measure the quality of the different positive spannings in high-dimensional space becomes a challenging problem.  In this paper, we introduce a novelty zero-order stochastic algorithm to tackle this problem. The idea comes from Sign-OPT.
